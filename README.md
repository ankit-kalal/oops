# class is a blue-print of how a object should behave
    1. data or property 
    2. function or behaviors or methods 
    
    class name should be in PascalCase format
    object is an instance of the class
    *object literal => a easy easy way to create objects


# ** Whats is function vs methods 
    1.method is a special function that is written inside of class


**constructor is a special method that is written inside of class and execute at a time of object creation

special/magic/dunder methods

# **Encapsulation
    -nothing is truly private in python

    __pin
    __menu

# **reference variables
    sbi = ATM()
    here sbi is a reference variable


class objects are also mutable
two types of variable instance variable and static/class variable 

# **Inheritance
    1. child class cannot access private data or method from parent Class
    2. if child class don't have constructor then it will access parent class constructor
    3.  #   method overriding  -> polymorphism
        #   method overloading
        #   operator overloading

# **polymorphism    
    1.  method overriding
    2.  method overloading
    3.  operator overloading


    
    #technically method overloading don't exist in python like java
